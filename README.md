# Zig Challenge

Welcome to the Zig Challenge. 

Your task is to build a CLI program in Zig that does the following...

- Takes a folder and a string as input
- Find all cases where the input is found in files within the folder
- It should show the file and line number for each result along with a preview of the surrounding text.


Bun is used to build a `node_modules` that will be used as the test bench for the program.

```bash
bun install
```
